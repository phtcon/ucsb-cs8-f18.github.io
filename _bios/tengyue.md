   Hi~ I'm Tengyue Hu, a second year Computer Science major here at UCSB. I am 
   also part of the UCSB IEEE club. I feel so lucky to become a tutor for CS8 
   this quarter because I really want to help you all succeed and continue to 
   develop your computer science skills in this course. I took CS8 last year in
   Summer quarter. Before this class, I have never seen code, let alone actually 
   write some code. If you are in the similar situation with me now, it is totally
   fine. Whenever you have some question about this course or about programming, 
   you can go and find me at any time. Other tutors and I are all extremely eager 
   to help you work through that! I look forward to meeting all of you and hope we
   have a great quarter! Feel free to reach me on Piazza ~
